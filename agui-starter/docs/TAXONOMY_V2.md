# Taxonomy V2 Overview

- Identity is resolved through `entities` linked to `entity_identifiers` (email or phone).
- Role helpers exist for Alliance, Guild, and House scopes to check if an entity has any of the required roles.
- UI features will migrate gradually to the new taxonomy. A compatibility view using `orgs_as_guilds` remains available during the transition.
