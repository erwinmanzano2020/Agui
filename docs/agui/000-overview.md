# Agui Overview

## TL;DR
- **Mission**: Ship an "Open-World RPG ERP" that lets franchise-ready retail teams level up their back-office and loyalty flows by making real data feel like an adventure HUD rather than spreadsheets.【F:docs/agui/001-vision.md†L124-L135】【F:docs/agui/001-vision.md†L424-L493】
- **Primary users**: Merchant guild owners and managers (e.g., Vangie Variety Store), frontline staff encoding time & attendance, and operators issuing loyalty passes across alliances, guilds, and houses.【F:docs/agui/001-vision.md†L124-L148】【F:docs/agui/001-vision.md†L424-L493】
- **Core loop**: Tune global theme and module toggles in `/settings`, experience the RPG-style hub at `/agui`, then dive into prioritized modules (Payroll Lite, CEODR, Employees) with reliability fixes and keyboard-first flows to keep daily ops humming.【F:docs/agui/001-vision.md†L124-L315】【F:docs/agui/001-vision.md†L413-L420】
- **Value props**: Single source of truth for payroll calculations, immersive modular UI that reflects tenant branding, loyalty hierarchy that scales from alliance to store, and shipping discipline that slices work into daily, testable wins.【F:docs/agui/001-vision.md†L24-L94】【F:docs/agui/001-vision.md†L124-L420】【F:docs/agui/001-vision.md†L424-L535】

## Pillars
- **Payroll truth & trust**: Preview, payslip, and PDF all draw from one computation engine with guardrail tests so finance can rely on every peso.【F:docs/agui/001-vision.md†L24-L90】
- **Keyboard-speed operations**: Optimize DTR bulk entry, POS, and other high-frequency flows for operators working on laggy hardware, with shortcuts and predictable focus states.【F:docs/agui/001-vision.md†L28-L60】【F:docs/agui/001-vision.md†L539-L590】
- **Tenant-themable RPG shell**: Theme tokens and module toggles live in Supabase, driving the `/agui` hub and future module shells without hard-coded colors or enablement flags.【F:docs/agui/001-vision.md†L124-L420】
- **Guild-to-House identity graph**: Alliances, guilds, houses, parties, and loyalty passes share a unified taxonomy so customers and staff can move across scopes without duplicate identities.【F:docs/agui/001-vision.md†L424-L535】
- **Result-first delivery rhythm**: Ship visible outcomes early, gather feedback, and iterate with full-file replacements to keep momentum and clarity in decision logs.【F:docs/agui/001-vision.md†L4-L8】【F:docs/agui/001-vision.md†L108-L116】【F:docs/agui/001-vision.md†L413-L420】
